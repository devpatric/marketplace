# Customization

All application customization-related configuration can be found in `config/app.php`.

## Application Name

See the `name` key in `config/app.php` and `APP_NAME` variable in `.env`.

## Application Locale

The application is available in English and Czech.

See `locale`, `fallback_locale` and `available_locales` keys in `config/app.php`.

Translation files are located in `resources/lang`, just the way it is common in any other Laravel application.

## Currencies

You are able to configure which currency will be selected by default in the offer creation form. See the `currency` key in `config/app.php`.
